                * The Attack Board is used to guess and hit the enemy's ships.
                * On your turn, click a square on the Attack Board to fire a shot.
                * If the shot hits a ship, it will be marked as a hit.
                * If the shot misses, it will be marked with a blue square and the turn passes to the opponent.
                * If you destroy an entire ship, it is marked as sunk with red squares.
                * After sinking a ship, you can continue shooting until you miss.
                * The game continues with alternating turns between you and the computer.
                * The game ends when one player sinks all of the opponentâ€™s ships.
